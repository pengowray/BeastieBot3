# Taxon Rules Configuration
# This file extends the legacy rules-list.txt with additional features.
#
# Features:
# - Exclusion patterns (exclude taxa from lists)
# - Main article links
# - List-specific overrides
# - Force-split rules
#
# The legacy rules-list.txt is still used for common names and wikilinks.
# This file adds newer features that can't be expressed in the legacy format.

# Global exclusion patterns (regex)
# Taxa matching any pattern are excluded from all lists
global_exclusions:
  # Example: exclude fossil-only taxa (if you had a pattern for them)
  # - "^Fossil "

# Taxa-specific rules
taxa:
  # Example: Chordata should always split into classes
  Chordata:
    force_split: true
    main_article: Chordate
    comprises: "vertebrates and some invertebrates"

  # Example: Squamata could split into Serpentes and Sauria if we had that data
  Squamata:
    force_split: true
    main_article: Squamata
    comprises: "lizards, snakes, and amphisbaenians"

  # Example: Testudines with main article
  Testudines:
    main_article: Turtle
    common_name: turtle
    common_plural: turtles and tortoises

  # Example: Anura with wikilink disambiguation
  Anura:
    wikilink: "Anura (frog)"
    common_name: frog
    common_plural: frogs

  # Example: Hygrophila with kingdom-aware disambiguation
  Hygrophila:
    wikilink: "Hygrophila (gastropod)"

  # Example: List-specific exclusion
  # Homo sapiens:
  #   list_overrides:
  #     mammals-cr:
  #       exclude: true
