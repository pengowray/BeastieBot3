# Taxon Rules Configuration
# This file extends the legacy rules-list.txt with additional features.
#
# Features:
# - Exclusion patterns (exclude taxa from lists based on regex)
# - Main article links ({{main|...}} templates in headings)
# - List-specific overrides (exclude/rename taxa per list)
# - Force-split rules (skip heading for a taxon, group by children instead)
# - Virtual groups (organize taxa by custom groupings instead of ranks)
#
# The legacy rules-list.txt is still used for common names and wikilinks.
# This file adds newer features that can't be expressed in the legacy format.
#
# Force-split example:
#   When grouping by "order", if Squamata has force_split: true, instead of:
#     === Squamata ===
#     * Species A
#     * Species B
#   The items will be pushed to the next grouping level (e.g., family):
#     === Colubridae ===
#     * Species A
#     === Viperidae ===
#     * Species B
#
# Virtual groups example:
#   For Squamata, instead of just splitting by family, we can define
#   logical groups like "Snakes" and "Lizards" based on superfamily/clade membership.

# Global exclusion patterns (regex)
# Taxa matching any pattern are excluded from all lists
global_exclusions:
  # Example: exclude fossil-only taxa (if you had a pattern for them)
  # - "^Fossil "

# Virtual groups define custom taxonomic groupings
# These override the normal rank-based grouping for specific parent taxa
virtual_groups:
  # Squamata: organize into Snakes, Lizards, and Worm lizards
  Squamata:
    # Groups are checked in order; first match wins
    groups:
